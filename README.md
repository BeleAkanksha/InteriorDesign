# InteriorDesign
A website to showcase the Interior Designer's Portfolio and a way for the customers checkout the designer's portfolio before requesting quotes and contacting the designers through the website.


We intended to make this website as a way for Interior Designer to showcase their projects whether ongoing, completed or queued for future on this website. 
The customers can view the Interior Designer's Portfolio, select designs and get quotes from them on their project.
Various Design themes and types are showcased from which the customers can choose their dream designs. 
This website is a way for the interior designer to reach more people as well as have an organized portfolio.

main/index page of the website is named as home.html so we recommend to access the home.html file/page first and then go ahead from there.
